## Clusters and features

Clusters: kinds of groups in the data

Features: aspects of the model (parameters) that vary by cluster

Examples (clusters -> features): 

- tanks -> survival
- stories -> treatment effect
- individuals -> average responses
- departments -> admission rate, bias


Adding more clusters involves adding more index variables and more population
priors.

Adding more features involves adding more parameters, increasing the dimensions
in each population prior.


Varying effects are a way to measure unmeasured confounds. Unmeasured features
of clusters leave an imprint on the data that can be estimated given
repeat observations of each cluster and partial pooling among clusters. 

This helps us, from the predictive perspective, to regularize cluster-level 
variance, and, from the causal perspective, to manage unobserved confounds
and competing causes using cluster-level causes.
