Recall: Generalized linear models have expected value as *some function*
of an additive combination of parameters. 

This means that a uniform change in predictor is not a uniform 
change in the prediction. And because of ceiling and floor effects, 
all predictor variables interact and moderate one another. Eg. if the
outcome space is bounded between 0-1 and one variable pushed the outcome
towards 1, another variable cannot push the outcome further to 1 - it is
bounded by this ceiling. 


### Example: confounded admissions

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggdag))
coords <- data.frame(
	name = c('G', 'D', 'A', 'u'),
	x =    c(1,    2,   3,  3.5),
	y =    c(0,    1,   0,  1.5)
)
```

```{r}
dagify(
	A ~ G + D + u,
	D ~ A + u,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```
