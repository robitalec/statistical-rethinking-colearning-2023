## Generalized linear models

### Modeling events

> Like tide prediction engines (analog computers), the gears inside the machine
bear no resemble to the observable predictions that they put out.

- Events are discrete, unordered outcomes
- Observations are counts of events
- Unknowns estimated are on the probability or log-odds/logit scale (probability it happens / probability it does not happen)

Linear models: expected value is an additive linear combination of parameters. 
Can only do this with the normal distribution because it is unbounded. 

Other events are bounded. For example, probability of events are restricted
to 0-1. 

Generalized linear models: expected value is some function of an additive combination 
of parameters. 

$Y_{i} \sim Bernoulli(p_{i})$

$f(p_{i}) = \alpha + \beta_{{X}} X_{i} + \beta_{Z} Z_{i}$

- $Y_{i}$: 0/1 outcome
- $p_{i}$: probability of event
- $f(p_{i})$: f() maps probability scale to linear model scale
- $\alpha + \beta_{{X}} X_{i} + \beta_{Z} Z_{i})$: can be any real value


$f$ is the link function

$f(p_{i} = \alpha + \beta_{{X}} X_{i} + \beta_{Z} Z_{i})$

$f^{-1}$ is the inverse link function. 

$p_{i} = f^{-1}(\alpha + \beta_{{X}} X_{i} + \beta_{Z} Z_{i})$


### Distributions

The distribution is matched to constraints on observed variables and the link 
function is matched to this distribution.

- Exponential distribution: time to event that has a constant rate. Greater than 0, 
single parameter $\lambda$ that defines the rate. 
- Binomial distribution: count events bounded in an observation window. Some number of trials 
- Poisson distribution: count events with constant rate. This is the count distribution of the exponentially distributed events. We don't know the maximum or number of coin tosses. 
- Gamma distribution: sum up exponential processes. 
- Normal distribution: Gamma distribution with large mean converges to the Normal distribution. 

Distribution you want to use to model an observed variable is governed by the 
constraints on observation. Eg. you can't have negative counts. You can't use 
some test to decide if your data are "Normal". 


### Logit link

Bernoulli and binomial models most often use the logit link. 

$logit$ is the link function

$logit(p_{i} = \alpha + \beta_{{X}} X_{i} + \beta_{Z} Z_{i})$

$logit^{-1}$ (logistic) is the inverse link function. 

$p_{i} = logit^{-1}(\alpha + \beta_{{X}} X_{i} + \beta_{Z} Z_{i})$


Logit link is a harsh transformation


```{r}
p <- seq(0, 1, 0.01)

ggplot(data.table(logit_p= logit(p), p = p)) + geom_line(aes(logit_p, p))

```


### Logistic priors

The logit link compresses parameter distributions. Anything above +4 = almost
always, anything below -4 = almost never.

### Example: UC Berkeley Admissions

- Graduate school applications for 1973 UC Berkeley
- Stratified by department and gender of application

#### 1. Estimand


```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggdag))
coords <- data.frame(
	name = c('G', 'D', 'A', 'G_star', 'R', 'U'),
	x =    c(1,    2,   3,   2,         4,   4),
	y =    c(0,    1,   0,  -1,        -1,   1)
)
```

Was there gender discrimination in graduate admissions?

```{r}
dagify(
	A ~ G,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```


- G: gender
- A: admission

```{r}
dagify(
	D ~ G,
  A ~ D,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```

- D: department

Typically, department is considered a mediating variable

What can the "causal effect of gender" mean?

```{r}
dagify(
	A ~ R + G_star + D,
	G_star ~ G,
	D ~ G,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```


Which path represents "discrimination"?

- direct discrimination: status-based discrimination from G -> A
- structural discrimination: indirect through department G -> D -> A
- total discrimination: G -> A and G -> D -> A, what individuals experience


For now, we will ignore the unobserved confounds between the mediator and 
the outcome. 
```{r}
dagify(
	A ~ G_star + D,
	G_star ~ G,
	D ~ G + U,
	A ~ U,
  coords = coords
) |> ggdag(seed = 2, layout = 'auto') + theme_dag()
```



#### 2. Generative model


- Set number of applicants
- Sample gender
- Sampled with preference for different departments by gender (indirect effect)
- Define acceptance rate for departments
- Simulate acceptance


Changing the acceptance rate where acceptance differs by department **and** gender, 
pattern of differences in acceptance rates is the same in this simulated data. 
This illustrates the fundamental problem of determining if discrimination is
occuring. 

Generative model could be greatly improved:

- Admission rates depend upon size of applicant pool and the distribution
of qualifications
- Admission rates are then based on ranking applicants to a set number of spaces

#### 3. Statistical model(s)

Total effect of G

$A_{i} \sim Bernoulli(p_{i})$

$logit(p_{i}) = \alpha[G_{i}]$
